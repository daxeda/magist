# Data analysis resolution 

In the context of our first team project, we are introduced to a potential partnership with a Brazilian SaaS, Magist. 

### Who are we? 

Eniac, an online marketplace specialised in Apple-compatible accessories. 
We were founded 10 years ago in Spain, since then, we've expanded in neighbouring countries. 
We are a provider of a professional tech support & consultations with customers. 
The current situation --> investors are requesting to scale up & rank up in e-commerce. 

As data analysts, we are challenged to find meaning in the data provided, and effectively 
communicate insights to our superior departements. 

### Our current situation: 

We currently have a lack of knowledge in the Brazilian e-commerce marketplace.
We don't have any ties with local providers, nor any package delivery services, or any customer service agencies. 

### Magist 

To help our expansion, we have a potential partnership proposition from a company called Magist. 
They are a Brazilian SaaS offering  a centralised order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores w/ biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
They are also a provider of after-sales services, stock and warehouse management, products shipping, customer service. 
They also have contracts with marketplaces and the Brazilian Post Office (reduce fees and cost) + bureaucracy involved on getting started (already sorted). 

The offer on the table stands for a three-year contract in which we could test, create brand awareness, and explore the option of setting up our own supply chain management. 

### Main concerns; 

Our catalogue is 100% tech products and apple-based products. It is therefore not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products. 
They have a deal with the post office, it might be cheap - but at what cost? Our question is, are deliveries fast enough? 

## Our main points: 

## 1 
- Magist offers too many categories of products that aren't relevant for us. Only 10% are tech-oriented.
- With these 10%, would we achieve the desired visibility for our brand and products?
- With further analysis, we quickly conclude that the current customers have tendencies to shop for the more affordable products, like computer accessories, and not expensive computers. Affordable products have higher sales. 

## 2
- The revenue produced by tech-oriented sales isn't aligned with our revenue, let's recall that we have a monthly revenue of 1.17 million euros.
- The database indicates a discrepancy with tech-oriented sellers (and customers).

## 3 
- Regarding deliveries, Magist's average delivery time is acceptable - with a 12.5 day delivery time.
- Would be potentially interesting to expand into the Brazilian market without paying the 60% import tax on the customs value.
- We calculated that 90% of deliveries arrived at their designated destination.

## Final insights 

- Market alignment → not optimal 
- Visibility concerns for our products. 
- Revenue gap for tech oriented sellers. 
- Sales performance → low for high-end products.
